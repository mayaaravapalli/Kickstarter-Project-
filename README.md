About 

Crowdfunding is a very popular choice for entrepreneurs looking to raise capital for a new venture. However, several crowdfunding campaigns fail because of mistakes made prior/during their funding period. We want to better understand what these factors that cause these campaigns to succeed/fail are so we can  help entrepreneurs launch campaigns under optimal conditions.

By analyzing data and building a classifier to predict successfulness of campaigns based on historical observations and trends, someone looking to start a Kickstarter campaign can be better informed about what works and what doesnâ€™t. This would also help Kickstarter because they want the projects on their platforms to be successful so they can get a percentage of the profits, as well as improve their brand image. 

The target variable for this specific business case will be if the kickstarter campaign was successful or if it failed.
